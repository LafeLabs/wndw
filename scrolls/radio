# RADIO SPECTRUM
 
## What  is  the  electromagnetic  spectrum?

There  is  not  a  simple  definition  of  the  spectrum.  From  the  technical 
viewpoint the spectrum is simply the range of electromagnetic waves that 
can be used to transmit information, but from the practical viewpoint the 
economic and  political aspects, as well as the technology actually used to 
convey the information by means of these waves, play pivotal roles.
As an example, when Marconi in 1902 first spanned the Atlantic with his 
“wireless telegraph message”, he  used the whole spectrum available at the 
time to send a few bits/s over an area of thousands of square kilometres.
With the spark transmitter used for this achievement that occupied all the 
frequencies that the existing receivers were able to understand, nobody else 
could use  radio for communications on a  radius  of  some 3500 km  from 
the  transmitting  station  in  England. So,  if  other  users  wanted  to  send 
messages  in  the  same  area,  they  would  need  to  coordinate  their 
transmissions in different “time slots” in order to share the medium. This 
technique is called “**TDMA**”, Time Division Multiple Access.
