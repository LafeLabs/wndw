# Physics
 
Wireless  communications  make  use  of  electromagnetic  waves  to  send 
signals  across  long  distances.   From  a  user’s  perspective,  wireless 
connections  are  not  particularly  different  from  any  other  network 
connection: your  web browser, email, and  other applications  all work as 
you  would  expect. But  radio  waves  have  some  unexpected  properties 
compared  to  Ethernet  cable. For  example,  it’s  very  easy  to  see  the  path 
that  an  Ethernet  cable  takes:   locate  the  plug  sticking  out  of  your 
computer, follow the cable to the other end, and you’ve found it! You can 
also be confident that running many Ethernet cables alongside each other 
won’t  cause  problems,  since  the  cables  effectively  keep  their   signals 
contained within the wire itself.

But  how  do  you  know  where  the  waves  emanating  from  your  wireless 
device are going? What happens when these waves bounce off objects in 
the room or other buildings in an outdoor link? How can several wireless 
cards be used in the same area without interfering with each other?
In  order  to  build  stable  high-speed  wireless  links,  it  is  important  to 
understand how radio waves behave in the real world. 

# What is a wave?

We  are  all  familiar  with  vibrations  or  oscillations  in  various  forms:  a 
pendulum, a tree swaying in the wind, the string of a guitar - these are all 
examples of oscillations.

What they have in common is that something, some medium or object, is 
swinging in a periodic manner, with a certain number of cycles per unit of 
time. Tis kind of wave is sometimes called a mechanical  wave, since it is 
defined by the motion of an object or its propagating medium.

When  such  oscillations travel  (that  is,  when the  swinging does  not  stay 
bound to  one  place)  then  we  speak  of  waves propagating  in  space. For 
example, a singer singing  creates periodic oscillations in his or her vocal 
cords. Tese oscillations periodically compress and decompress the air, and 
this  periodic  change  of  air  pressure  then  leaves  the  singers  mouth  and 
travels, at the speed of sound. 

A  stone  plunging  into  a  lake causes  a  disturbance,  which  then  travels 
across the lake as a ***wave***.

A wave has a certain ***speed***, ***frequency***, and ***wavelength***.

These are connected by a simple relation:

$$
Speed = Frequency * Wavelength
$$

The  wavelength  (sometimes  referred  to  as  ***lambda***, $\lambda$)  is  the  distance measured from a point on one wave to the equivalent part of the next (or, 
in a more technical way, to the next point that is in the same phase), for 
example from the top of one peak to the next.

The frequency is the number of whole waves that pass a fixed point in a 
period of time. Speed is measured in metres/second, frequency is measured 
in  cycles per  second  (or  Hertz,  represented  by  the  symbol  Hz),  and 
wavelength is measured in metres. For example, if a wave on water travels 
at one metre per second, and it oscillates five times per second, then each 
wave will be twenty centimetres long:

$$1 metre/second =  5 cycles/second *W$$
$$W = 1 / 5 metres$$
$$ W = 0.2 metres =  20 cm$$

Waves also have a property called amplitude. Tis is the distance from 
the centre of the wave to the extreme of one of its peaks, and can be 
thought of as the “height” of a water wave. Frequency, wavelength, and 
amplitude are shown in Figure RP 1.

Waves in water are easy to visualize. 

Simply drop a stone into the lake and you can see the waves as they move 
across the water over time. In the case of electromagnetic waves, the part 
that might be hardest to understand is: “What is it that is oscillating?”
In  order  to  understand  that,  you  need  to  understand  electromagnetic 
forces.
