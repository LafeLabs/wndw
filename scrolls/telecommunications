# 2. TELECOMMUNICATIONS BASICS

The purpose  of  any  telecommunications  system  is  to  transfer  information 
from the sender to the receiver by a means of a communication channel.
The information  is  carried  by a  signal, which  is  certain  physical  quantity 
that changes with time.

The  signal  can  be  a  voltage  proportional  to the  amplitude  of  the  voice, 
like in a simple telephone, a sequence of pulses of light in an optical fibre, 
or a radio-electric wave irradiated by an antenna.

For  analog  signals,  these  variations  are  directly  proportional  to  some 
physical  variable  like  sound,  light,  temperature,  wind  speed,  etc.  The 
information can also be transmitted by digital binary signals, that will have 
only two values, a  digital ***one*** and  a  digital ***zero***. Any analog signal  can  be converted  into a  digital signal  by appropriately  ***sampling*** and  then coding it. The sampling frequency must be at least twice the maximum frequency present  in  the  signal  in  order  to  carry  ***all***  the  information  contained herein.  Random  signals  are  the  ones  that  are unpredictable  and  can  be described only by statistical means.

Noise  is  a  typical  random  signal,  described  by  its  mean  power  and 
frequency distribution. A signal can be characterised by its behaviour over 
time or by its frequency components, which constitute its spectrum. Some 
examples of signals are shown in Figure TB 1.
